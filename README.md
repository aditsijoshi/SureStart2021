Following a 6 week AI curriculum 
Day 1:
  So far Aartificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have been buzzwords that I heard but felt like never
  actually understood. Through this program I hope to clear away that sense of unknown. Doing projects with 
  tangible differences is also very cool to me and the program will therefore assist me in getting to that
  point. I also hope to get involved in research at University of Washington and this experience should help
  me convince a CS lab to take me on.
