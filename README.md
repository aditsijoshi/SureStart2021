Following a 6 week AI curriculum 
Day 1:
  So far Aartificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have been buzzwords that I heard but felt like never
  actually understood. Through this program I hope to clear away that sense of unknown. Doing projects with 
  tangible differences is also very cool to me and the program will therefore assist me in getting to that
  point. I also hope to get involved in research at University of Washington and this experience should help
  me convince a CS lab to take me on. 

Day 2:
  1. Supervised learning models are trained using a predetermined set of data where the input and output of the
  are known. Unsupervised learning models find relationships and patterns between the given data without a predetermined
  input and output. Supervised learning involves a H(x) or hypothesis function and a J(x) or cost funciton (degree of 
  wrongness function). The goal for these functions is to optimize and minimize them. 
  
  2. Skikit Learn independently was created to help make integration for a lot of different tools easier for developers
  and data scientists. Therefore, its real appeal is its ability to provide that umbrella for NumPy, Pandas or GraphViz.
  Skikit Learn alone does not really provide the ability to vizualize data without its supporting libraries.
